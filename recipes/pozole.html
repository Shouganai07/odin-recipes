    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe will teach you how to cook menudo, a traditional mexican soup that has hominy (treated rehydrated corn) and cow's belly, this dish is usually used as a hangover cure after parties.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Pounds of Honeycomb tripe</li>
        <li>2 limes</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic cut in half</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion cut into 4 pieces</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>6 quarts of water</li>
        <li>2 15oz cans of ready-cooked white hominy, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>3 small sprigs of mint</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the Honeycomb tripe from the package, drain and rinse.</li>
        <li>Place in a large pot or bowl and squeeze the lime juice over the tripe and fill the pot with water.</li>
        <li>Let the tripe soak in that lime juice and water solution for 30 minutes, then drain and rinse again.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse again, pat dry with paper towels, and cut into 2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Place the pieces, with the onion, garlic and bay leaf in a large pot with a lid and fill with the water.</li>
        <li>Place on medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Skim off the foam that will form on the top after a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Now, partially cover the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, and gently simmer for about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Once it's cool enough to handle, chop the meaty parts and discard the bones, return the meat to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the drained and rinsed white hominy along with oregano, and the sprig of mint. Keep cooking slowly, for about another ½ hour. If the tripe if too chewy, it needs more cooking.</li>
        <li>Add salt as needed. Some cooks like to add granulated chicken bouillon to add more flavors to the broth instead of salt.</li>
        <li>Serve the White Menudo soup in bowls and garnish.</li>
    </ol>
