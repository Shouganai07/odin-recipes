        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract, (5 ml)</li>
        <li>12 ounce can evaporated milk, (354 ml)</li>
        <li>14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk, (396 ml)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whole milk, (60 ml)/li>
        <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream, (475 ml)</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons powdered sugar, (24 g)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, (2.5 ml)</li>
        <li>Ground cinnamon, for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Separate the eggs into two other mixing bowls.</li>
        <li>Add ¾ cup sugar to the bowl with the egg yolks and mix on high speed until yolks are pale yellow. Add ⅓ cup milk and vanilla and stir to combine. Pour the egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and stir gently just until combined (don't over-mix).</li>
        <li>Use electric beaters to beat the egg whites on high speed. As the begin to whip into stiff peaks, gradually mix in the remaining ¼ cup of sugar. Fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into the batter gently, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl, until combined. </li>
        <li>Pour batter into un-greased pan and smooth it into an even layer. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow cake to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Combine the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and whole milk in a small bowl. Once the cake has cooled use a fork to poke holes all over the top of the cake. </li>
        <li>Slowly pour the milk mixture over the the top of the cake, making sure to pour near the edges and all around. Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour or overnight, to allow it to soak up the milk.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, whip the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks. Smooth over the top of the cake. Sprinkle cinnamon on top.</li>
    </ol>
