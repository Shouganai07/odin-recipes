    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe will teach you how to cook chilaquiles, a traditional mexican dish consisting of crispy, fried corn tortilla chips (totopos) simmered briefly in hot green or red salsa that makes the chips slightly softened.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 corn tortillas, preferably stale, or left out overnight to dry out a bit, quartered or cut into 6 wedges</li>
        <li>Corn oil, or other neutral oil for frying</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups red chile sauce or salsa verde</li>
        <li>Sprigs of epazote, optional</li>
        <li>Cotija cheese or queso fresco</li>
        <li>Crema Mexicana or creme fraiche</li>
        <li>Cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>Avocado, sliced or roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large sauté pan, coat pan generously with corn oil, (1/8 inch), heat on medium high to high. When the oil is quite hot, add the tortillas, fry until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove tortillas to a paper towel lined plate to soak up excess oil. Sprinkle a little salt on the tortillas.</li>
        <li>Wipe pan clean of any browned bits of tortillas. </li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of oil to pan, bring to high heat again. Add the salsa and let salsa cook for several minutes. If you have a few sprigs of epazote, add them to the salsa.</li>
        <li>Add the fried tortilla quarters to the salsa. Gently turn over the pieces of tortilla until they are all well coated with salsa. Let cook for a few minutes more. </li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Serve chilaquiles with garnishes and fried eggs.</li>
    </ol>
